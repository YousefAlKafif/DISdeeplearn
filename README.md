# DISdeeplearn
This is the final report of my honors Directed Independant Study course for Deep Learning Applications. It is a summary of what I have learned on deep learning and applying it practically. I had spent a semester learning independantly through online resources. Topics include:
- Machine Learning & Deep Learning
- ANNs
- CNNs
- Supervised vs Unsupervised Learning
- RNNs
- LSTMs
- SOMs
- AutoEncoders
- Use of computer vision libraries
- Practical coding using machine learning and data science libraries
- Multiple projects, including one that is published on Kaggle link : https://www.kaggle.com/yousefalkafif/digit-recognizer-mnist-using-fastai
